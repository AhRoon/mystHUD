About
--------
This hud was made by rayshud, currently maintained by CriticalFlaw. This hud is a custom game ui modification for Team Fortress 2, it combines a few elements from multiple other huds but with rayshud as its main.

I like rayshud, which is why I am NOT going to edit most of the contents. My edits are only certain elements that I find very 'off', or can be improved to my liking.

This edit is published for fans who like my version of rayshud.

Difference
--------
The most obvious difference in this edit is changing the cyan to white. I am not a big fan of rayshud's cyan color. Another big change is making most hud elements white in color, rather than using the default TF2's dull white color.

Updates
--------
You can expect this hud to be updated pretty regularly. The updates will mostly be forked over from CriticalFlaw's rayshud as soon as he updates it.

I do not make huds and have limited knowledge on it, thus you may find certain elements of the hud broken.
